Tasks for the MINA Credentials Standard proposal
================================================

1) Draft and test some basic contract ideas

- Done ! Very basic contract and structs

2) Document the proposal 

- Include goals, motivation, design choices, etc. 
- Replace current `draft.ts`. 
- Describe why we propose to use actions, and why to have most info on-chain.
- Identify existent ideas (herald, and zkCredentials form zkIgnite2) 
- Research other existent standards (soulbounded NFTs, etc)
